║  ⚠️  CRITICAL: THIS IS A PATTERN CONTINUATION PUZZLE         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

THE TRANSFORMATION RULE:
• The output extends the input vertically to a fixed height (typically 10 rows)
• The non-zero pattern in the input has a directional "flow" or periodic structure
• Continue/extrapolate this pattern downward following the same trajectory

HOW TO IDENTIFY THE CONTINUATION:
• Find the repeating unit or directional shift in the input pattern
• Determine the vertical period (how many rows before the pattern repeats or shifts)
• Determine the horizontal shift per period (how much the pattern moves left/right)
• Continue applying this same shift/repetition until the output height is reached

EXAMPLES OF PATTERN TYPES:
• Diagonal movement: pattern shifts horizontally as it extends down
• Vertical repetition: same column pattern repeats with a fixed period
• Combination: pattern has both horizontal shift and vertical periodicity

YOUR APPROACH:
1. Analyze the input to find the period/shift of the pattern
2. Create output with extended height, same width
3. Copy input to top of output
4. Continue the pattern downward using the discovered period/shift
