║  ⚠️  CRITICAL: THIS IS A SUBREGION EXTRACTION PUZZLE         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

THE TRANSFORMATION RULE:
• The input grid can be divided into a grid of equal-sized blocks
• The output is one specific block extracted from the input
• Identify which block position is consistently selected across examples

HOW TO SOLVE:
1. Determine the block size by comparing input and output dimensions
2. Mentally divide the input into a grid of blocks
3. Identify which block (by position) appears in the output
4. The position is consistent across all examples (e.g., always top-right, always center, etc.)

KEY INSIGHT:
• The output is a DIRECT COPY of one region - no transformation applied
• Find the matching region by checking each possible block position
• The selected region is at a FIXED position relative to the grid structure
