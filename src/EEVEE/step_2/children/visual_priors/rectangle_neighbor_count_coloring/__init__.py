Rectangle Connection Count Coloring

Pattern: Multiple rectangular blocks in the input are recolored based on
how many other rectangles are CONNECTED to each one.

The connection count determines the output color - each distinct count
maps to a different output color. Rectangles with fewer connections
get one color, rectangles with more connections get a different color.

Example: A grid of rectangular blocks where corner blocks (fewer connections)
get one color, edge blocks get another color, and interior blocks 
(most connections) get yet another color.
