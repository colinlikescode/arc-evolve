║  ⚠️  CRITICAL: RECTANGULAR FRAME DUPLICATION PUZZLE          ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

THE TRANSFORMATION RULE:
• Find the rectangular FRAME structure (a closed border of a distinctive color)
• Note the frame's dimensions and the color filling its interior
• Search the grid for another region with a similar-sized cluster of the same interior fill color
• Draw an IDENTICAL frame (same color, same dimensions) around that cluster
• The original frame stays unchanged; you're ADDING a duplicate frame

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
• The frame color is distinct from the background and interior colors
• The interior of the frame contains a uniform or mostly uniform fill
• Look for "empty" or uniform rectangular regions that match the frame's interior size
• The duplicate frame preserves the exact shape and thickness of the original
