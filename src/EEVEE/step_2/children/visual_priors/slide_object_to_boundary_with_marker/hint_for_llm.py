║  ⚠️  CRITICAL: OBJECT SLIDES TO BOUNDARY WITH TRAIL MARKER  ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

THE TRANSFORMATION RULE:
• There is a BOUNDARY LINE (solid row or column of one color)
• There is a MOVABLE OBJECT (a shape made of another non-background color)
• The object SLIDES toward the boundary line until it is adjacent to it
• A MARKER LINE (third color) is placed at the edge where the object started
• The object's original location becomes background (cleared)

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
• The boundary line remains fixed in place
• The object maintains its exact shape, just relocated
• The marker line spans the same dimension as the boundary (full row or column)
• The marker appears on the far edge of where the object originally occupied
• Direction of movement: object moves toward the boundary from wherever it is

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP:
• Object ends up immediately next to the boundary line
• Marker line appears on the opposite side of where the object landed
• The marker essentially "closes off" the region the object traveled through
