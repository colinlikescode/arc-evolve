║  ⚠️  TEMPLATE COMPLETION WITH ORIENTATION MARKERS            ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

THE TRANSFORMATION RULE:
• Find multiple skeletal shapes made of a "connector" color
• Each shape has a "marker" cell (different accent color) indicating orientation
• ONE shape is the TEMPLATE - it has full decorations around the skeleton
• OTHER shapes are INCOMPLETE - they need decorations added

TO COMPLETE EACH INCOMPLETE SHAPE:
1. Identify the template shape (has decorations beyond skeleton + marker)
2. Note the relative position of decorations to the marker in the template
3. For each incomplete shape, determine how it's oriented relative to template
4. Apply the decoration pattern with appropriate reflection/rotation
5. The marker position anchors the orientation transformation

KEY INSIGHT: The marker color appears at a specific position on each skeleton.
Compare marker positions to determine the rotation/reflection needed to map
the template's decorations onto each incomplete structure.
